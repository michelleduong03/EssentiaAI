# EssentiaAI

EssentiaAI is a local-first, command-line tool for abstractive text summarization. It uses Hugging Face's `google/pegasus-xsum` model, built on top of PyTorch and Transformers, to generate high-quality summaries from long-form content.

## Features

- High-performance summarization using `google/pegasus-xsum`
- Runs entirely offline after setup â€” no API keys or external services
- Simple CLI interface for quick usage
- Built with Python 3, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers
- Keeps all input data on your local machine for privacy
