# ðŸ§  EssentiaAI

EssentiaAI is a lightweight, local-first command-line tool for abstractive text summarization. It leverages Hugging Face's `google/pegasus-xsum` â€” a state-of-the-art transformer model â€” to generate concise and context-aware summaries from long-form text.

The project is designed to be privacy-conscious, fast to set up, and easy to use. All processing happens locally, ensuring full control over your data.

- **High-quality summarization** using `google/pegasus-xsum`, optimized for short, informative summaries

- **Built on robust libraries**: Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch
- **Simple, interactive CLI** for pasting or typing input directly into the terminal
